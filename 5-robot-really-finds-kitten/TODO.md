# Notes

This round I'm aiming at the minimal *legitimate* Robot Finds Kitten: There is one non-kitten item, and you don't know what the kitten will look like. Anything else is gravy.

# Plan for this iteration, after last retro

* TDD everything (but types count as tests in some situations, I suspect.
* Split stories smaller.
* You don't need a library, you need a solution to the small problem at
  hand.
