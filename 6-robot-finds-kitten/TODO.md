# Notes

This round moves us to having gameplay that's actually like Leonard's original version of Robot Finds Kitten, which means that tomorrow I move on to a *different game*. Exciting! It's going to be a challenge, but I also have more time today than I have in a while.

# Plan for this iteration, after last retro

* Narrow changes.
* Decouple your types.
* Omit the inessential from tests.
* Let the tests be your safety net.
